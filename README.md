# Machine Learning Project for Adult Data Set 
A polling institute wants to be able to estimate an individual’s income from his/her personal data (see einkommen.train). To this aim, 30.000 individuals were interviewed concerning the features summarized below. For some of the individuals, not all features are available. Crucially, the income of only 5.000 of the interviewee’s is known. Task was to predict the income group of the remaining 25.000 interviewees and to prepare the data such that they can be used for further regression and correlation analyses.
