# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Income-Aduld-data
A polling institute wants to be able to estimate an individual’s income from his/her per- sonal data (see einkommen.train). To this aim, 30.000 individuals were interviewed con- cerning the features summarized below. For some of the individuals, not all features are available. Crucially, the income of only 5.000 of the interviewee’s is known. Your task is to predict the income group of the remaining 25.000 interviewees and to prepare the data such that they can be used for further regression and correlation analy- ses.
