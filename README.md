# Machine Learning Project for Adult Data Set (Intelligent Data Analysis & Machine Learning Course from the University Potsdam)
A polling institute wants to be able to estimate an individual’s income from his/her personal data (see einkommen.train). To this aim, 30.000 individuals were interviewed concerning the features summarized below. For some of the individuals, not all features are available. Crucially, the income of only 5.000 of the interviewee’s is known. Task was to predict the income group of the remaining 25.000 interviewees and to prepare the data such that they can be used for further regression and correlation analyses.



What have been done:

1. Exploratory data analysis for data set
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Selection
4. Trained/ Hyper Parameter Tuning and Validation for the 4 ML  Models (for 4 different Data sets)
    - Random Forest
    -  Decision Tree
    -  SVM
    -  Logistic Regression

5. Predicted unlabeld Data with the final Models

For this Project Python 3.8 has been used:
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Sklearn
   - Seaborn
   - Matplotlib
